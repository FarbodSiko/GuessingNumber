# GuessingNumber
This project is simple and fun Guessing Number .


HOW THE PROGRAMM WORKS:
1-first of all download the modules that i imported at the top of the code with this commands:
windows : pip install <module name>
mac : pip3 install <module name>
linux : pip install --user <module name>
2- then set the lower bound and the higher bound.
for exmaple if we want to guess  a number between number 10 to 20 . in this case the number "10" is the lower bound and the "20" is the higher bound.
3-as always enjoy the repos :)
